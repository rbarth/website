      <p>Welcome to my online portfolio! My name is Rebecca Barth, a 21 year old aspiring web-designer
         and copy writer! A former english and psychology major, I decided a few years ago to take a new direction
        with my education. I am currently entering my senior year as a Web Design and Development
        major at Davenport University.
